Task:
A turtle should move to another turtle

Definition:
The task is pretty the same as a previous one.
There are two objects (two turtles). Your task is to make one turtle move to
another. For solving this task you have to know following notes:
1) Simulation is provided by turtlesim
	rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

2) In turtlesim there have to be two turtles with names:
	turtle1
	victim
And victim should move to turtle1

3) Poses of turtle1 victim could be read from topics /turtle1/pose and
/victim/pose. Structure of messages from these topics you could see typing 
in terminal:
	rosmsg show turtlesim/Pose
This could be imported to python code with:
	from turtlesim.msg import Pose

4) Command messages should be published in topic /victim/cmd_vel. Structure of
messages from this topic you could see typing in terminal:
	rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
Pay your attention that there are only two fields in this structure:
	Vector3 linear
	Vector3 angular
And each of them have three own fields (x,y,z)
	For moving only coordinates linear.x and angular.z are used. Other coordinates are dropped.

5) To spawn new turtle you have to call service /spawn
(with [x, y, theta, name] parameters)
You could do it in two ways:
a) In python by spawn_func = rospy.ServiceProxy("/spawn",Spawn)
                spawn_func(x,y,theta,"<name>")
   Don't forget to imoprt
                from turtlesim.srv import Spawn
b) in terminal call rosservice call /spawn x y theta "<name>"
