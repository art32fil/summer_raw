Simple formulation, somplicated implementation:

using previous code implement the point that follows another point. You should move one point using a keyboard (you can use turtle_teleop_key), and another point should follow the first one. 

Add difficulty:
* Once one point reaches another it changes color and on a place of meeting the new point appears
