Task:
1) To create an application, that draws a word "hello" with turtles.
2) Create a launch file for it

Definition:
Every node should spawn new turtle that will come on a screen and mark a letter
(one node for letter 'h', one for 'e', one for 'l' and one for 'o')

For solving this task you have to know following notes:
Two numbers that are provided to /turtle1/cmd_vel (linear.x and angular.z)
presents a number of how much turtle should go forward and how much does it 
rotate. For example during following code:

rospy.Publisher("/turtle1/cmd_vel",
                geometry_msgs.msg.Twist,
                queue_size=10).publish(Twist(linear =Vector3(x=3),
                                             angular=Vector3(z=5)))

turtle1 goes forward on 3 cells and rotates on 5 radians
